# Ear-Training-app-using-SpotifyAPI-Backend-Java-SpringBoot

The Ear training app is made for music learners and it helps the user to practice their skills in guessing the scale/key of the played song.
The application will ask the user to guess the scale of the played song from his Spotify Playlists, Searched Albums as well as top tracks of Searched Artists in the form of a quiz.
For the backend I have used Java,Spring Framework,Rest APIs and Hibernate.
PostgreSQL is used for the database.
